# SideProject
My first side project in C#

DoctorPatient is a simple scheduling program I am currently working on for practice.

I am building a user interface that will interact with a SQL database and perform CRUD operations based on user input. Eventually I will implement http communication and build the API's to perform the CRUD operations. I'd like to also attach a decent front end to it. For now, the program executes on the command line.
